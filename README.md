The project was to correct syntax errors in the provided program. At completion of the project the program should be able to receive simple math problems and output the equation with the solution. Example 2+2 input and output 2+2=4. I think that I did well to find and solve the syntax error. I have experience coding at this point for this kind task to just take under a minute to complete. Where I could improve is how I choose to comment in the code. Here I attempted to comment every change I made. Though on a second look at the project, it looks messy and hard to read. This project wasn't much of a challenge, though the skill of troubleshooting problems like this was essential for later projects in this course.
